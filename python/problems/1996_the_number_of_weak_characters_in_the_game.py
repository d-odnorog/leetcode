class Solution:

    # 1. rearrange the order of attack and defense
    # 2. count weak characters (those defenses less than the current maximum defense)

        # we can set the init value to x where x < 1
        maxDefense = 0
        # sort properties with custom sort comparator
        # if the attack is same, then sort defense in descending order
        # otherwise, sort attack in in ascending order
        p.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]), reverse=True)
